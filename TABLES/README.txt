TABLES - Custom Wavetables for nUPIC
=====================================

Place audio files here to use as wavetable presets in the Wavetable Editor.

SUPPORTED FORMATS:
- WAV (.wav)
- AIFF (.aif, .aiff)

RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS:
- Single-cycle waveforms (one complete wave cycle)
- Any sample rate (files are automatically resampled)
- Mono or stereo (stereo files use left channel)
- Any bit depth supported by SuperCollider

FILES ARE AUTOMATICALLY:
- Resampled to 2048 samples for wavetable playback
- Normalized for consistent amplitude

TIPS:
- Short single-cycle waveforms (256-2048 samples) work best
- Longer files will be resampled/compressed to fit
- Filename (without extension) appears in the preset menu
- Files are scanned when the wavetable editor first opens

SOURCES FOR WAVETABLES:
- Adventure Kid Waveforms (AKWF) - free single-cycle waveforms
- Serum/Vital wavetables (single .wav exports)
- Record your own single cycles from hardware synths
